Facial-emotion-recognition-model-using-ResNet-and-PyTorch
Developed a real-time facial emotion recognition system leveraging deep learning and computer vision techniques. The project involved training a ResNet-based convolutional neural network on the FER2013 dataset to classify human emotions from facial expressions captured via a webcam. 

Key Features:
Data Preparation: Utilized the FER2013 dataset, consisting of 48x48 grayscale facial images labeled with seven emotion categories (Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Sad, Surprise, Neutral).
Model Architecture: Fine-tuned a pretrained ResNet-18 model to accurately classify facial emotions, achieving high validation accuracy.
Real-Time Detection: Integrated OpenCV for real-time face detection and emotion prediction using laptop or external webcams.
User Interface: Displayed live video feed with bounding boxes and emotion labels superimposed on detected faces.
Applications:sable in human-computer interaction, mental health monitoring, and customer feedback analysis.
